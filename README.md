heremaps
========

A Splunk app for map visualizations using HERE maps

This app requires that you have HERE api credentials. See http://developer.here.com for requesting them.

You can set these credentials using the setup dashboard.

Or you can configure them in heremaps/local/setup.conf


It includes 3 different visualizations types, one reverse geocoding custom command and a couple of csv lookups.

For questions about the app, please raise them on http://answers.splunk.com

When you spot bugs please file an issue on https://github.com/pvanisacker/heremaps/issues

Note this app is not at all supported by HERE.

Enjoy!
